        "\n",
        "Q1) What is a parameter?\n",
        "- A parameter is a variable that defines a model’s internal configuration and is learned from the data during training. For example, in linear regression, the slope and intercept are parameters. These values determine how the model makes predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2)  What is correlation?\n",
        " What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        " - Correlation measures the statistical relationship between two variables. It tells us whether one variable changes in relation to another. Correlation values range from -1 to +1:\n",
        "\n",
        "- +1 means perfect positive relationship.\n",
        "- -1 means perfect negative relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Negative correlation means that when one variable increases, the other decreases. For example, the number of hours spent watching TV might negatively correlate with academic performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3) Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
        "- Machine Learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence where computers learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed.\n",
        "The main components are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dataset (input data for learning).\n",
        "- Features (independent variables used for prediction)\n",
        "- Model/Algorithm (mathematical representation for learning patterns)\n",
        "- Loss function (measures how far predictions are from actual results)\n",
        "- Optimizer (method to update parameters)\n",
        "- Training & Testing process (to evaluate performance).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4)  How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
        "- The loss value represents the error between predicted and actual results. A lower loss means the model is performing well. If the loss is high, it means the model is making poor predictions. Monitoring loss during training helps us know if the model is improving.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5)  What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        "- Continuous variables are numerical and can take infinite values within a range (e.g., height, weight, temperature).\n",
        "- Categorical variables represent discrete groups or categories (e.g., gender, colors, country names).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6) How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",
        "- Categorical variables cannot be directly fed into models, so we encode them into numbers. Common techniques are:\n",
        "- Label Encoding (assigning each category a unique integer)\n",
        "- One-Hot Encoding (creating binary columns for each category)\n",
        "- Ordinal Encoding (for ordered categories, e.g., small < medium < large).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7) What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
        "- Categorical variables cannot be directly fed into models, so we encode them into numbers. Common techniques are:\n",
        "- Label Encoding (assigning each category a unique integer)\n",
        "- One-Hot Encoding (creating binary columns for each category)\n",
        "- Ordinal Encoding (for ordered categories, e.g., small < medium < large).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8) What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
        "- It is a module in scikit-learn that provides utilities for preparing data before feeding it into a model. It includes scaling, normalization, encoding categorical data, handling missing values, and feature transformations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9)  What is a Test set?\n",
        "- The test set is a portion of the dataset that is kept aside during model building. It is only used to evaluate the final performance of the model after training.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10) How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
        " How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?\n",
        " - We use the function train_test_split from scikit-learn:\n",
        "\n",
        "- from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  \n",
        "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Here, 80% data is used for training and 20% for testing.\n",
        "- I approach the ML problem as:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Understand the problem and data\n",
        "-Collect and clean data\n",
        "- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
        "- Feature engineering and preprocessing\n",
        "- Split data into train/test sets\n",
        "- Choose and train a model\n",
        "- Evaluate performance with metrics\n",
        "- Optimize model (tuning hyperparameters)\n",
        "- Deploy and monitor the model\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11) Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n",
        "- EDA helps us understand the data’s structure, patterns, correlations, and anomalies. It identifies missing values, outliers, and skewed distributions. Without EDA, the model may be trained on poor-quality data and give unreliable results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12)  What is correlation?\n",
        "- Correlation is a statistical measure of the relationship between two variables. (Same as Q2, but answer with clarity if repeated in exam.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13) What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "- Negative correlation means when one variable increases, the other decreases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14)  How can you find correlation between variables in Python?\n",
        "- We can use Pandas or NumPy.\n",
        "  import pandas as pd\n",
        "  df.corr()   # gives correlation matrix\n",
        "- Or visualize using seaborn.heatmap(df.corr()).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15)  What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Causation means one variable directly affects another. Correlation only shows a relationship, but not necessarily cause-effect.\n",
        "Example: Ice cream sales and drowning cases are correlated (both increase in summer). But ice cream does not cause drowning. The cause is high temperature.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16) What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example.\n",
        "- An optimizer is an algorithm used to adjust model parameters to minimize the loss function.\n",
        "Common optimizers:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Gradient Descent: updates parameters step by step in the direction of - steepest decrease of loss.\n",
        "- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): uses one random sample at a time to update parameters, faster but noisier.\n",
        "- Adam: combines momentum and adaptive learning rate, widely used in deep learning.\n",
        "- RMSProp: scales learning rate based on past gradients.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17)  What is sklearn.linear_model?\n",

        "Q19)  What does model.predict() do? What arguments must be given?\n",
        "- predict() uses the trained model to make predictions on new/unseen data.\n",
        "Argument:\n",
        "- X (features) → new input data for prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20) What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",

        "\n",
        "Q21)  What is feature scaling? How does it help in Machine Learning?\n",
        "- Feature scaling transforms numerical values into a standard range (e.g., 0–1 or mean=0, std=1). It prevents features with large values from dominating models. Example: Age (20–60) vs Salary (20,000–100,000). Scaling ensures fair comparison.\n",

        "Q22)  How do we perform scaling in Python?\n",
        "- Using scikit-learn:\n",
        "\n",
        "from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler\n",
        "\n",
        "scaler = StandardScaler()  \n",
        "X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)\n",
        "\n",
        "StandardScaler → mean=0, std=1\n",
